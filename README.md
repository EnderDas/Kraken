# Kraken
Python Game Framework and Rendering System

### Game Engine?
My original idea for Kraken was for it to be a game engine... Thats when I started to look into what really went into game engines.

So what that means is that now, this is a "framework" per-say. My biggest trouble with making and working on games is actually creating and developing a solid framework to the mechanics of the game, and over time I've come up with some tools for me to handle and create solid game mechanics (IE. Frame class, BlueDB.) My one goal now is to really take all of those ideas for mechanics in games and incorporate them into one giant customizable and easy to write framework

### Kraken Language
TODO: write this...
